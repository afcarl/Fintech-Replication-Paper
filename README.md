# Fintech Replication Paper
This Repository contains a Group Project from Utrecht University where the goal was to replicate the results of a paper by Feng et Al (2018) by making use of Python. It required a lot of data wrangling and figuring out how the different packages worked but we managed to do it reasonably well. Due to lack of extensive methodology documentation, our results do not perfectly align with theirs.

**Edit 11 November 2019:** It's fun looking back at this project and the sheer amount of duplicate code we have written (or copied from different sections), inefficient adding of colums etc. All in all perhaps a great example of *inefficient* code where the excuse '*Don't touch it because it works!*' strongly applies.
