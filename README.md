# Fintech Replication Paper
This Repository contains a Group Project from Utrecht University, and the first time touching Python, where the goal was to replicate the results of a paper by Feng et Al (2018) by making use of Python. It required a lot of data wrangling and figuring out how the different packages worked but we managed to do it reasonably well. Due to lack of extensive methodology documentation, our results do not perfectly align with theirs.
